        The Euclidean distance formula was used to calculate the difference between each userâ€™s 
        engagement metrics and the centroid of cluster 1. This measure reflects how far or close 
        a user is from the least engaged cluster.

        The Engagement Score distribution is heavily skewed towards the left, indicating a majority of scores concentrated in the lower range. 
        The majority of scores fall within the range of 0 to 50, with very few scores exceeding 50.

        The Experience Score distribution also exhibits a leftward skew, although less pronounced than the Engagement Score distribution.
